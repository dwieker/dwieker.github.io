I'm an aspiring Data Scientist in San Fransisco and currently a student at Metis -- an immersive 12 week program (funded by Kaplan!) focused on training industry ready data scientists. 

In this blog I write about some of the projects I've been working on. I'm interested in new Data Science opportunities, so please feel free to contact me if you're interested in hiring! I'm a recent college grad with a strong math/physics background, machine learning skills and software engineering experience.

Education:  
B.S. Physics, Minor Mathematics  
California Polytechnic University, 2016

Non-Nerdy things:  
Snowboarding, motorcycles and hiking help maintain my sanity outside of the work place!
