The goal of this project was to estimate the opening box office gross of popular movies before release by quantifying internet "hype." I originally wanted to look at twitter search volume/content for movies in the months leading up to the release, but discovered that it's difficult to scrape twitter data more than two weeks old. A great website for scraping data, however, is wikipedia. A lot of people tend to check wikipedia for a movie synopsis before they decide to watch it. In summary, I found a fairly strong correlation between wikipedia page visits for a given movie in the month leading up the release and total opening weekend revenue.

In addition to wikipedia data, I used google keywords to find the total google search volume for the trailer of each movie over time. In the graph below, you can see spikes in search volume which  correspond to the trailers release (derp)

As a final feature of my model, I included the seasonal trends of profits:

With these 3 predictors I achieved an R^2 of around .70.
