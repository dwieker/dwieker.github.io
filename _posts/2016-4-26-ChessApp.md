title: Desktop Chess App and Chess Engine
---

I'm terrible at chess, but recently I've been on a mission to learn more about the game. There's a lot of free applications
on the internet that will pit you against a chess AI and analyze your moves, which is ridiculously when you don't have
anybody to play against or don't want to feel rushed. The histroy of chess engines is actually pretty interesting. Modern
computers can easily defeat any human player -- even grandmasters -- but there have been my variations of algorithms
and techniques before that was so. With the help of online chess AI resources, I decided to attempt my own chess engine and 
see if it could beat out any of my moderately skilled friends.
