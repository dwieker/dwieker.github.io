This plot shows the similarity between 1000 popular subreddits, based off common word usage. Over 20 million comments from a 3 week period were used. Click the icons in the bottom left to enable panning and zooming. Hover over a bubble to see the name of the subreddit. Larger bubbles represent more active subreddits. 

Points that are closer together are "more similar", based off of the word usage in each subreddit's comments. The visualization only approximates similarity; the features of each subreddit are word frequencies, which can be thought of as vectors in high dimensional "word" space. These vectors are then projected down to 2 dimensions using [principal component analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) to allow visual inspection of clusters.
