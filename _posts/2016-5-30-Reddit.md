[Reddit](http://www.reddit.com) is a massive news and entertainment site driven purely by user submitted content. To keep posts thematically organized, the website is paritioned into "subreddits", which are essentially forums with a specific purpose or topic. For example, there's gaming subreddits, sports subreddits, tv show subreddits, and a subreddit for almost anything else you can think of. 

As of now, there's no fast and easy way to discover new subreddits pertaining to your own interests. People share subreddits amongst each other, and occasionally you'll stumble across one you like, but for some reason there's no form of subbreddit *recommendation*.

Thus, I was inspired to create a simple, personalized recommendation service that generates relevant subreddits from a user's reddit data. Specifically, every user has a publically viewable comment history that contains the time, content and parent-subreddit of every comment they've ever posted. If a user is fairly active on the site, you can use this data to profile their interests incredibly well -- and thus use this "interest profile" to suggest liekly relevant subreddits.

To map a user's comment data to relevant subreddits, it would useful to create a measure of subreddit simularity. Given sub X, find what subs Y most resemble X. For example, given some subreddit focused on an RPG game, spit out subreddits that focus on other similar RPG games. 

To accomplish this, I started by collecting over 20 million reddit comments


This plot shows the similarity between 1000 popular subreddits, based off common word usage. Click the icons in the bottom left to enable panning and zooming. Hover over a bubble to see the name of the subreddit.  Subreddits that are closer together are "more similar", which is determined by the word usage in each subreddit's entire corpus of comments (during a 3 week period in March, 2015*). Over 20 million comments were compared. Larger bubbles represent more active subreddits. 

*** 

This visualization only approximates similarity; the features of each subreddit are word frequencies, which can be thought of as vectors in high dimensional "word" space. These vectors are then projected down to 2 dimensions using [principal component analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) to allow visual inspection of clusters.
