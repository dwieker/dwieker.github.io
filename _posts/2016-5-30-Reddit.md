[Reddit](http://www.reddit.com) is a massive news and entertainment site where users submit and vote on shared content. The website is subdivided into "subreddits", which are essentially forums with a specific purpose or topic. For example, there's gaming subreddits, sports subreddits, tv show subreddits, and almost anything else you can think of.

As of now, there's no easy and fast way to discover new subreddits pertaining to your own interests. People share subreddits amongst each other, and occasionally you'll stumble across one you like, but there's no form of subbreddit *recommendation*.

Thus, the goal of this project was to create a simple, personalized recommendation engine that generates relevant subreddits based on a user's past comment history. Every user has a publically viewable comment history that contains the time, content and subreddit of every comment they've ever posted. If a user is fairly active, you can use this data to profile their interests incredibly well. 


This plot shows the similarity between 1000 popular subreddits, based off common word usage. Click the icons in the bottom left to enable panning and zooming. Hover over a bubble to see the name of the subreddit.  Subreddits that are closer together are "more similar", which is determined by the word usage in each subreddit's entire corpus of comments (during a 3 week period in March, 2015*). Over 20 million comments were compared. Larger bubbles represent more active subreddits. 

*** 

This visualization only approximates similarity; the features of each subreddit are word frequencies, which can be thought of as vectors in high dimensional "word" space. These vectors are then projected down to 2 dimensions using [principal component analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) to allow visual inspection of clusters.
