A few years back MIT released a paper describing a ridiculously cool method of measuring a person's heart rate from a standard video recording. Every time your heart beats, blood vessels near the surface of the skin on your face dilate and slightly affect the absorbtion of incident light. The effect is too feignt to see with human eyes, but can be picked up on with a camera and signal processing technqiues. The above video is some [open source python software I wrote to do just that.](https://github.com/dwieker/FaceTrack). You'll need openCV installed to use it.

The short explanation of methods used:
1. Take a spatial average of the RGB values near the center of a person's face every frame
2. Apply independent component analysis to the RBG time series.
3. Take the FFT of the components and filter for signals within a reasonable range for a heart rate.
4. Pick the most promenent frequency.

I left out a bit, but that's the core of it.
