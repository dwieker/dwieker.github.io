A few years back MIT released a paper describing a method to measure a person's heart rate from a standard video recording. Every time your heart beats, blood vessels near the surface of the skin on your face dilate -- this changes the absorbtion of incident light. The effect is too feignt to see with human eyes, but can be picked up on with a camera and signal processing technqiues. The above video is some [open source python software I wrote to do just that.](https://github.com/dwieker/FaceTrack). You'll need openCV installed.
