A few years back MIT released a paper describing a ridiculously cool method to measure a person's heart rate from a standard video recording. Every time your heart beats, blood vessels near the surface of the skin on your face dilate and slightly changes the absorbtion of incident light. The effect is too feignt to see with human eyes, but can be picked up on with a camera and signal processing technqiues. The above video is some [open source python software I wrote to do just that.](https://github.com/dwieker/FaceTrack). I also added a few features to make the signal extraction more robust. You'll need openCV installed.
