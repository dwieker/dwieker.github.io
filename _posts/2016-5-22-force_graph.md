You can embed d3 into these jekyll github blogs! I'm using [vida.io](https://vida.io/) to host the visualization and the "iframe" html5 tag to render it here. Check the page source!

For those unfamiliar with "d3": It's essentially a java script library that allows you to easily create "data driven (web) documents" (3 d's... GET IT?). For example, in the visualization above, each node is bound to a 2D points. You can minuplate these 2D points and use d3 to easily render the bounded notes and lines in an html document, avoiding the arduous task of manually modifying html attributes.
