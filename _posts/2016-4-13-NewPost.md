title: New York MTA Turnstyles
---
New York MTA data is [publicaly available](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) and ripe for visualization/analysis. For our first project at Metis, we used this transportation data to generate a solution to a problem faced by some hypothetical company -- for example, where to strategically place advertisements in high volume subway stations. My group decided to search for regions in New York with high potential for real-estate development. We guessed that most people commute from residential regions into various, potentially distant business hubs in the morning (derp), and that we might find regions where development of new business parks would reduce transit congestion and travel times for people far from any active business areas. To look for these regions, we overlayed transit activity on a map:

This map shows transit activity during morning hours on weekdays. Each colored point represents a station. Blue corresponds to people primarily entering the station (on foot, through the turnstyles), and red to people primarily exiting the station. The size of the points are proportional to the total number of people entering and exiting the station. You can see that people commute from the outer areas (almost all blue) into Manhattan and a few other business "hot spots" (some of the red points may simply be transfer stations, however). In the evenings, people commute back home:

Notice that most of the previously blue stations in sparse regions turn more red. 

This is nice for visualizing the flow of commuter traffic and might be useful in a preliminary search for where to place new business parks or residential areas.
