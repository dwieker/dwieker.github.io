title: New York MTA Turnstyles
---
New York MTA data is [publicaly available](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) and ripe for visualization/analysis. For our first project at Metis, we used this transportation data to generate a solution to a problem faced by some hypothetical company -- for example, where to strategically place advertisements in high volume subway stations. My group decided to investigate regions in New York with high potential for real-estate development. We guessed that most people commute from distant residential regions into various business hubs in the morning (derp), and that we might find regions where development of new business parks would reduce transit conjestion and travel times for people far from any active business areas. To look for these regions, we made a heat map:

This map shows the transit activity during morning hours on weekdays. Blue corresponds to people primarily entering the station, and red to people exiting the station. The size of the points are proportional to the total number of people entering and exiting the station. You can see that people commute from the outer areas (almost all blue) into the inner city and a few other business "hot spots". In the evenings, people commute back home:
